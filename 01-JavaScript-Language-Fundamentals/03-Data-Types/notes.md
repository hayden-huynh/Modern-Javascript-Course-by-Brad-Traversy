# Primitive data types
- Stored directly in the location the variable accesses
- Stored on the stack
- These are:
  - String
  - Number
  - Boolean
  - Null
  - Undefined
  - Symbols (ES6)

# Reference data types
- Accessed by reference
- Objects that are stored on the heap
- A pointer to a location in memory
- These are:
  - Arrays
  - Object Literals
  - Functions
  - Dates
  - Anything else
  
# JavaScript is dynamically typed
- Types are associated with values and not variables
- The same variable can hold multiple types
- We do not need to specify types
- Most other languages are statically-typed (Java, C#, C++)
- There are supersets of JS and add-ons to allow static typing (TypeScript, Flow)
